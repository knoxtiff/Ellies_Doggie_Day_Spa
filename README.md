# Ellies_Doggie_Day_Spa
Quickstart Bootcamp - Project 1 - HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 

Name: Tiffany Vargas
Overview of Project: Creating a small business website for an imaginary doggie day spa business imspired by my pup. 
How to Use: The website serves as a hub for the business.  On the Home page, it displays the work done with custom pictures of clients in Ellie's Pups of Instagram. 
    It contains links to the supplementary pages which allow perspective customers to see the menu of services & pricing (tabeles), testimonials (link through nav and home page), and contact us (form submission). 
    The website is meant to inspire a sense of peace and happiness through sweet fur babies. 
Tech used: HTML, CSS, GIT, and BOOTSTRAP 
Ideas of Future Improvement:  1. An about us page to introduce the owners and inspiration 
                              2. Adding an interactive ability to schedule from the website 
                              3. Adding a small shop section to order custom pup items like tees, harnesses, leashes, etc.
